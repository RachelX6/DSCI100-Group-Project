    "## Group 42 Project Proposal : The Classification of Wine Quality\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "White wine is one of the oldest and most cherished alcoholic beverages known to humanity. It is not merely a drink; it is a wonderful interaction between flavors and aromas, a product of nature's alchemy and human craftsmanship that is commonly enjoyed before a meal, with dessert, or as a refreshing drink between meals. White wine is known for its light and refreshing taste, which sets it apart from many of its red wine counterparts. Due to its acidity and aroma, white wine is also useful in cooking, helping to soften meat and enhance the flavors of various dishes. The essence of white wine lies in its quality, a multifaceted concept that encompasses various chemical components and sensory attributes. \n",
    "\n",
    "This study delves into the complexity of wine quality, using a systematic approach to assess white wines on a scale of 1 to 10.  Our research focuses on five fundamental chemical properties: pH, density, alcohol content, residual sugar content, and citric acid.  As each of these elements plays a crucial role in shaping the taste, aroma, and overall character of the wine, we would like to build a model to predict the score of wine quality by the five properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project uses the Wine Quality dataset of the white variant of the Portuguese \"Vinho Verde\" wine. This dataset contains 4898 observations of white wine with 12 attributes for each observation, however, only 6 of the attributes will be used for this classification project. This particular dataset contains no missing values.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Research question: Can a wine’s quality be accurately predicted on a scale of 1 to 10 based on its pH, density, alcohol content, residual sugar content, and citric acid?\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin thinking about how to approach this question, we must first take a look at the raw data set. We will first load in a few useful packages for loading and working with our data set."
